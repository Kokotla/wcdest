{"name":"WCDest","tagline":"Program for clustering expressed sequence tags","body":"### About WCD\r\nWCD is a program for clustering expressed sequence tags. It is published under the GPL2. It has been tested on MacOSX, Linux and Windows and is parallelised for pthreads (multi-core) and MPI. Extensive documentation is available. The underlying algorithsm are described in papers listed below\r\n\r\n### Download\r\nYou can download WCD from GitHub. The latest available version can be found there. Binaries can be found at http://www.bioinf.wits.ac.za/software/wcd but these may not be the latest versions\r\n\r\n### Papers\r\n\r\nIf you use WCD, please cite\r\n\r\n* S Hazelhurst, Z Lipták.
